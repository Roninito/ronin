/**
 * Example: Approval Workflow Agent — Phase 10D
 *
 * Demonstrates event-driven workflows with human-in-the-loop approval.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Register approval workflow kata
 * 2. Start task with expense data
 * 3. Task sends notification and waits for approval
 * 4. External system (manager) approves/denies via event
 * 5. Task completes or fails based on decision
